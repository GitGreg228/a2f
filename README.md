# a2f - Superconductor properties calculation
Solving Eliashberg equations is effective and accurate way to calculate superconducting critical temperature. The Eliasberg function a2f(w) is required for this method. It can be computed using the parameters of electron phonon coupling:
```math
$a^2f=$
